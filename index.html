<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Hello There I am Matt i am 27 my main interests are Football , Cycling and Science Fiction movies , I  came to Code Nation to learn new skills and to see if the skills can help in the future. </p>

<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 1</h2>
<h3> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
<p>
    Information technology is used for storing, protecting, processing, securing, transmitting, receiving, and retrieving information , In Worldwide Businesses IT is a crucial element to how companies operate in a modern environment , IT technology allows companies and organisations to expand their operations in business environments. For example, when companies expand they get bigger and look for ways to store information to focus time on other parts of the business , using IT to help store information in databases and build websites to improve marketing and attract customers through the sales of their product. 
<br>
<br>
    Information technology allows companies to reduce costs and increase productivity in areas like sales , accounting, marketing, and human resources so they can centralize their resources on other key aspects of the business. Today, most companies store digital versions of documents on servers and storage devices rather than paper based as this saves time and money and is much more efficient so this shows how companies have used IT as a benefit of technology throughout the years. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Another key way IT has transformed relationships between customers and businesses is through the use of Customer relationship management (CRM) these systems record every interaction a company has with a customer, so that a more personal experience is possible. If a customer calls a call center with an issue, the customer service rep will be able to see what the customer has purchased, view customer information, call up the log manual for that issue and effectively respond to the issue.
    <br>
    <br>
    Lastly the way Information Technology has improved communication for businesses is changing rapidly , email when first released was effective , easily obtainable and widely used and allowed people to message each other for questions and things relating to companies. Modern 21st century has allowed even more tech advancement for communication , Skype is now used for video conference calls and a message based system , Smartphones are also critical and most people have access to apps that can benefit a work environment like Linkedin and Skype. Most People think IT is mainly computers and Mobile Technology but as part of a business , printers and 3D Printers are what they use modernly and is considered IT technology.

<h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully
    </h3>
<p> 
        When Digital Projects are being constructed they can be made into various projects in our case Websites but video games, app development , social media are also projects that digital project managers work with frequently.
       <br>
       <br>
       The digital project manager for a major project like a website needs to be a good team leader and communicate with his colleagues ,needs to be good at technology and excellent at time keeping , 3 main aspects are the ability to Create and Communicate a project plan, schedule, and Assign tasks and deadlines as well as frequent check-ins to other team staff , most project managers have to be involved in technology and have some expertise of managing emails and data for example sales cloud. 
       <br>
       <br>
       Project Leaders are people persons and have interpersonal skills to have great leadership skills and is an essential skill to being a good project manager. A strong leadership role means leading and managing teams ,   setting the visions, motivating the team, serving them, coaching them and inspiring others.
       <br>
       <br>
       In relation to methods and resources the team project leader can use these can vary but are mostly technology based and include email , in house databases and some experience of marketing through a previous job.
       <br>
       <br>
       Digital Project Managers use various resources when planning projects the first being content management systems to manage their data and resources for their project , when building a website this is a crucial tool used , it's easy to download and user friendly making it crucial for design.
       <br>
       <br>
       HTML is the next skill that is required as if working in a team and the leader knows this skill it helps less experienced  developers if the project is falling behind especially useful for devoting time to more complex tasks if the team leader focuses on HTML , Social Media is critical for project leaders as knowing when to engage with sites like facebook and  twitter as project ideas can be beneficial to the work.
       <br>
       <br>
       This can lead to advertisements within these popular sites for getting your project known to get people talking about it especially if it is a website for something not currently known about like a video game.
       <br>

<h3>Unit 1 , Outcome 2 Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful
</h3>

<p>


<h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
</h3>

<p>
    During the use of my website the tools i used were extremely useful firstly i used VS Code to input my text for the website blog , i wrote it on google doc beforehand and then pasted it to code and linked it with CSS which allowed me to edit and colour my website.
    <br>
    <br>
    When using VS Code the more I used it the more proficient I became , any changes i saved were linked to a file where i could see what my website would look like. 

    I Also backed my data up using Github and this allowed me to send my work off to be checked for the project , using my  trello boards i effectively planned my data and what needed to be worked on.
    <br>
    <br>
    I felt my approach did change during the project as I focused on the content more so than the design of my website because my strengths are data inputting and focusing on word content as opposed to design content like photos and the way my website looked.
    <br>
    <br>

<h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate
</h3>

<p>
        The IT Tools i used were appropriate as I felt that I had experience from the first week of using VS Code and i knew i had used it and wanted to improve and use what I knew to make my website and its content the best it could be.
        <br>
        <br>
        My website benefited from using google docs to manage my word based content and I could once i learned how , was put this into my VS Code files for the website.

        I changed the font and colour scheme using VS Code and inserted my website content into it. 
        <br>
        <br>
        VS code is easy to learn and manage and i used paragraphs and line breaks to separate my content , then learned about CSS to edit colours and make my design look more like a website and this concludes why i thought the IT Systems for the website were excellent to use.
        <br>
        <br>


<h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
</h3>

<p>
        During my project and designing my website I felt it went well in some areas and some i felt i could of done more and improved on , my website i feel in areas is a bright colour scheme and i like the content i put in because I worked hard to fill this with detailed answers that fills it out.
        <br>
        <br>
        Certain aspects of my website I feel are a little basic although this is due to time constraints and I had lots of content to produce which is the main aim for the site , the weakness I felt held me back slightly for this project was the design aspect of creating a colourful attractive website , i am new to coding and took a little time to get used to VS Code and CSS which meant I had to take longer to research how to code and use CSS to colour and make my website have good layouts.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would have changed the way I learned about VS Code and done more research to prepare for website development and believe this would have benefited me.
        <br>
        <br>
        What I would change for the website is that during the design stage i would try to experiment more for colour schemes and design logos etc to make my website more unique and easier to look at.
        <br>
        <br>
        I felt my content took priority which was good but with more time and practice I felt my website would look better during the end.
        <br>
        <br>
              

<h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
</h3>

<p>
       Further improvements I feel I could make to the website and what I would change for the website is that during the design stage i would try to experiment more for colour schemes and design logos etc to make my website more unique and easier to look at.
       <br>
       <br>
       I felt my content took priority which was good but with more time and practice I felt my website would look better during the end. 
       <br>
       <br>
       My website if I were to do this project again would benefit from my experiences during the course in that I feel much more confident using code from when I began the course , the increased knowledge for doing the website again , and designing everything would be quicker.
       <br>
       <br>   
</p>
<h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
</h3>

<p>
        Outcomes for matching requirements and making sure the quality is good depended on how my website looks and its final content , I reviewed my content regularly to make sure each part of the assignment met the criteria.
        <br>
        <br>
        This was true when developing using xcode as i had to make sure there were no errors that could affect my website , using trello I marked each completed parts of the work and double checked for grammar before posting text to xcode.
        <br>
        <br>
        Having pages that didn't contain errors was vital and I double checked this through starting on google docs , images did not apply to me for the site as I did not use them much however I did make sure that any images I were to use for the site were the correct file format for inserting on VS Code.
        <br>
        <br>
        next linking pages i used and this was on VS Code when i created a file link to CSS and to my web page document to see how it would look , they had to be linked the right way from my index html on VS Code , I inserted the main CSS into this and had to all connect together.
        <br>
        <br>
        
</p>
<h3>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems 
</h3>

<p>

<h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
</h3>

<p>

        During my website development I worked on my site by myself and felt this gave me the right amount of my own ideas to incorporate into my website , being in a team may have been more less interactive to my own ideas in terms of allocating tasks and could of made the website less efficient as each member of a team could of worked on design or the website content that i may not have liked.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall i feel my  efficiency only suffered through my lack of knowledge for design and colour using CSS and VS code i felt i had basic knowledge for putting my content in the site. Again team work would not have benefited me i felt for the website as the website needed to be my idea for customisation and own ideas , a team group would have split ideas and would negatively affect the project.
        <br>
        <br>
        My solo productivity and efficiency went well as my website was made the way I wanted and I learned how to use VS Code by myself meaning if i was in a team i may not have had time or chance due to other tasks not including coding to learn it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another way I felt I could of been more efficient for my website was for the website itself and the design scheme this means logos and pictures and the overall background of my site , I used basic colour schemes and with more time and knowing more for CSS i felt my site could have been more interactive and looked better.
        <br>
        <br>
</p>


<h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
</h3>

<p>
        
       Ways I could improve efficiency and productivity through doing projects and the site during my development are similar to what i have use while studying at codenation , being efficient is tailored towards both technology and in a setting where you feel happy and confident. 
       <br>
       <br>
       Having regular breaks makes people feel more relaxed and more energetic to work on a project to take a break , I have done this at codenation and in addition to being more efficient i have watched presentations from companies at my time here and this helps efficiency in that i learn more about sectors and industries to put into practice if I had work like coding one day. 
       <br>
       <br>
       Also at codenation during my study time we have regularly had social events and this means we can relax after coursework and this helps manage work and makes everyone look forward to something , exercise such as yoga also is something we can participate in as exercise is healthy for a positive mind.
       <br>
       <br>

       </p>

<h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
</h3>

<p>    

      Next time I am producing a website i feel i would be placed better due to my  experience from this website and i have more coding skills and learned trello so my plan for the site would be better prepared and arranged. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The things I would do differently next during a project of this magnitude would be that I would research more about coding and how to use tools better for editing the site , i have worked in teams here and feel I have improved that aspect of working on projects involving teams and working on a specific role to communicate with other members of the group.
      <br>
      <br>
      If I was to be in a team for a similar project in the future , i feel i would be able to input more to the site through using VS Code i can now accurately insert data onto there and set the website content on , slack has been useful for the time here through messages and sharing links and next on a team project i feel i would use this better and know how to show others the benefits.
      <br>
      <br>



</p>
<h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
</h3>

<p>

     To test my websites and content I would test for bugs in my website and commit tests to make sure my content is good , it is vital to check for these faults beforehand I would use developer tools like VS Code and run tests there to make sure the content is good and fits correctly on my site.
     <br>
     <br>
     as my website was being published it is important to run checks for applications used so there are no errors on my site.
     <br>
     <br>
     Security is a key point for this as the site has to be secure and not have any data breaches that could prevent people going online , performance testing is good for pre releasing my site and to make sure it is easily accessible and runs the right way so easy access is available.
     <br>
     <br>
</p>
       







<h3>Unit 1 , Outcome 1 Plan and carry out tasks using IT 
    </h3>
       
<p>

       To Plan and make my website I will use various technology and methods to achieve my goals , firstly to plan my website and know my checklist i use Trello and have a board to plan my goals , such as  creating website , tasks currently being completed and References.
       <br>
       <br>
       I have included a link to my trello board and this is what I am using to plan the website for example logging what I need to do ,  in my website design I will be mainly using Visual Studio Code to design and code the website which i learned in week 1 of Develop Coding at Code Nation i learned the basics of Javascript and will incorporate this into my website design. 

 
      <a href= " https://trello.com/b/O8oGE5gF/unit-1-improving-productivity-with-it">https://trello.com/b/O8oGE5gF/unit-1-improving-productivity-with-it</a>
</p>
<h3> 1.4 ,  Describe the risks that might impact digital projects
   </h3>

<p>

        There are risks that can impact digital projects in serious ways the main one is funding and companies pulling out if they face financial difficulty , executives of companies can also suddenly pull funding if they don't agree with a project that is not going in the right direction.
        <br>
        <br>
       Poor Money management and miscalculation of costs for supplies are another bad example of how projects can go wrong , for example a company may go to a cheaper supplier and the money could be wasted if it isn't suitable for the organisation. 
        <br>
        <br>
       Next risk is Schedules and these are major important because companies have to meet deadlines and schedules can go wrong through mismanaging diary systems or technology , the risk that activities will take longer than expected , Slippages in schedule typically increase costs and delay the receipt of project benefits, with a possible loss of competitive advantage. 
        <br>
        <br>
       Performance Risk is another issue within a company  and this can occur when a specification for a project and a set way of doing it can lead to issues within a group team environment , one person may take over and know more than the others , this can cause someone to dictate the group coursework and make a project fail due to things being completed incorrectly because of one person. 
        <br>
        <br>
       their risks to consider are outside parties or software that you use being updated like IOS for example when you are working on a project using a current operating system , Apple could release a newer software update and this could mean your work because it is on the older operating system fails to load or has bugs. 
        <br>
        <br>
<h3> 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software
    </h3>

<p>
        When selecting IT systems and the right technology and software for my website design I would research  what I have to consider what the benefits and advantages of the software is and more advantageous to my task. For Example if i was working on a website I would research what software such as design and coding I would use for the development. 
        <br>
        <br>
        beginner based tools are more useful for my level of coding , tutorials would benefit me to help make the website efficiently. The next consideration I would consider would be the features included in the tech i use , free features would be more beneficial to a paid account as this allows complete customisation and offers more than having to sign up for a paid account.
        <br>
        <br>
        Virtual Studio Code i have used regularly and it is easily available and has over 100 coding languages such as Javascript , HTML and CSS, this is a good tech to use for beginners and is fast and quick to achieve what I need , whether I am designing what my website looks like or using Javascript to put my text for the website.
        <br>
        <br>
<h3> 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. 
  </h3>

<p>

        Using Trello has helped me because on my trello board I have planned out what i am doing for each task for example i have a board for each task i am working on such as 1.1 and when i have completed this i will tick this as done on my board helping me to track what has been done.
        <br>
        <br>
        Trello is easy to follow and remind me of what i am currently working on , trello also uses the Kanban System which is easy to keep track of during work and allows lists to be created for the benefits of my project.
        <br>
        <br>
        Git  is an Open Source distributed version control system ,  It is mainly used for source code management in software development.  Github is a web based hosting service and helps with code version control on that it is extremely popular with coders and for development purposes it is like social media for experienced developers.
        <br>
        <br>
        using this allows me to upload code and back files up on the system , allowing me to document my work and showcase it. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Since Github is a repository it allows me to track changes in my code across different versions and can integrate with other systems like amazon and google cloud if i were to use these in the future.
        <br>
        <br>

    <a href= "https://www.quora.com/What-is-GitHub-generally-and-what-is-it-mainly-used-for?redirected_qid=5104390">https://www.quora.com/What-is-GitHub-generally-and-what-is-it-mainly-used-for?redirected_qid=5104390
    </a>

<h3> 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects
   </h3>

<p>

         Legal Guidelines that impact digital projects are very numerous the first most important one is you have to disclose the Identity of your business , this includes Company Name so you can be identified , the registered address and the place of registration.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other details needed to be included are the postal address and email address , for people who are not technical and cant access computers the company must include a way to be contacted through non electronic means , so it is key the business has this sorted for digital projects.
        <br>
        <br>
        GDPR regulations are next and majorly affect businesses these came into effect in may 2018 and improves the rights of people who want to access their own data and how it is being processed , it needs to be made clear when signing up to a company through a form or email application.
        <br>
        <br>
        Companies can make the customers opt in so data is only given through consent and can make it easier for customers to opt out , lastly also have a process for data breaches in worst case scenarios.
        <br>

<h2>Unit 2  Website Software Outcome 1 : Create Structures and Styles for a webpage</h2>
<h3> 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
<p>

         For my website and it’s content layout I started of with my home page and logo with a blue background colour scheme and red and black text , i started my website with an about me section introducing myself and what brought me to codenation , this was a good introduction as it introduces my website before I move on to the website main content.
         <br>
         <br>
         Page 2 was text similar to the first one in paragraphs , and this is for 2.1 describing methods , skills and resources needed to complete digital projects again i inserted references at the bottom of the page. 
         <br>
         <br>
         On this page I then carried on with 2.2 describing whether IT Tools were appropriate and 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project in paragraphs , 2.4 and 2.5 were in red text colour and started with 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project and 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose. 
         <br>
         <br>
         I then moved to the next title unit 1 outcome 3 develop and test solutions , starting with  3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency , the next paragraph was 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.
         <br>
         <br>
         3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects was next followed by 3.4 ,  Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions and this finished the content for this part of the site.
         <br>
         <br>
         Coming towards the next page was plan and carry task using IT and began with 1.4 describing risks that impacted digital projects followed by 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology.
         <br>
         <br>
         1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes and had a reference at the bottom.
         <br>
         <br>
         1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects was next and concluded this page , for the last section and page of the site it was unit 2 website software creating structuring styles for the site.
         <br>
         <br>
         1.1 describing the content and layout of pages is the task I'm working on now , 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites was next followed by , 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account.
         <br>
         <br>
         The last part of the site followed by reference was 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites concluding the site.
         <br>
         <br>




<h3> 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
</h3>

 <p>
        When websites are created for companies they need to ensure that copyright protections are in place and most websites have a copyright protection statement in their website easily seen , all the website and its contents are under copyright material provided it is original to the owner. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This copyright statement can deter other people from copying or stealing content through threats of prosecution , some businesses can not realise or do it on purpose as they don't care about stealing work and passing it off as their own. Companies need to make sure that they own and control their own copyright material and respect boundaries of other companies in relation to confidential files and copyright laws.
        <br>
        <br>
        3 key points companies need to keep aware of are  that the companies need to only make use of license and copyright free images. That they detect or monitor other companies that are using their copyrighted materials and that they protect and have a secure website that protects them through copyright.
        <br>
        <br>

<h3> 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them

<p>     For people living with disabilities it can be a challenge to access the internet like everybody else , for example people who are blind or partially sighted they may not be able to read text as it may be too small for them to see , if they are colour blind the site may have lots of colour to specify which part of the website to visit and this can pose issues for this person with the disability.
        <br>
        <br>
        To get around this and help make the website more accessible for disabilities companies could use other ways of communicating the information such as enlarging text and using videos for sound , this makes it more easy for people with visual impairments to feel part of a website.

<h3> 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites

</h3>

<p>     When using file types for websites they are a variety of different ones , the main ones being HTML and most pages created for a website will be through HTML and it stands for Hyper Text Markup Language File.
        <br>
        <br>
        it is a computer language specifically designed for website creation , These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet making it useful for my website so it can be marked. It is easy to pick up, with the basics being accessible to most people  to use , and efficient in what it allows you to create.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another File type that works well with HTML is JPG and this stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group and  is the most popular used on search engines , these are used for inserting images in this case to my website and aren't the only image formats , the other 2 being GIF and PNG , JPG was designed to make photographs have good quality through images online on search engines.
        <br>
        <br>
        It compresses images and makes them smaller and easier to edit and use for online purposes ,Most online image programmes open JPEG files such as Microsoft Windows Photos and is easily accessible particularly on microsoft computer systems.
