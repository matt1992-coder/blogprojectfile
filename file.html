<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 1</h2>
<h3> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
<p>
    Information technology is used for storing, protecting, processing, securing, transmitting, receiving, and retrieving information , In Worldwide Businesses IT is a crucial element to how companies operate in a modern environment , IT technology allows companies and organisations to expand their operations in business environments. For example, when companies expand they get bigger and look for ways to store information to focus time on other parts of the business , using IT to help store information in databases and build websites to improve marketing and attract customers through the sales of their product. 
<br>
<br>
    Information technology allows companies to reduce costs and increase productivity in areas like sales , accounting, marketing, and human resources so they can centralize their resources on other key aspects of the business. Today, most companies store digital versions of documents on servers and storage devices rather than paper based as this saves time and money and is much more efficient so this shows how companies have used IT as a benefit of technology throughout the years. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Another key way IT has transformed relationships between customers and businesses is through the use of Customer relationship management (CRM) these systems record every interaction a company has with a customer, so that a more personal experience is possible. If a customer calls a call center with an issue, the customer service rep will be able to see what the customer has purchased, view customer information, call up the log manual for that issue and effectively respond to the issue.
    <br>
    <br>
    Lastly the way Information Technology has improved communication for businesses is changing rapidly , email when first released was effective , easily obtainable and widely used and allowed people to message each other for questions and things relating to companies. Modern 21st century has allowed even more tech advancement for communication , Skype is now used for video conference calls and a message based system , Smartphones are also critical and most people have access to apps that can benefit a work environment like Linkedin and Skype. Most People think IT is mainly computers and Mobile Technology but as part of a business , printers and 3D Printers are what they use modernly and is considered IT technology.

<h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully
    </h3>
<p> 
        When Digital Projects are being constructed they can be made into various projects in our case Websites but video games, app development , social media are also projects that digital project managers work with frequently.
       <br>
       <br>
       The digital project manager for a major project like a website needs to be a good team leader and communicate with his colleagues ,needs to be good at technology and excellent at time keeping , 3 main aspects are the ability to Create and Communicate a project plan, schedule, and Assign tasks and deadlines as well as frequent check-ins to other team staff , most project managers have to be involved in technology and have some expertise of managing emails and data for example sales cloud. 
       <br>
       <br>
       Project Leaders are people persons and have interpersonal skills to have great leadership skills and is an essential skill to being a good project manager. A strong leadership role means leading and managing teams ,   setting the visions, motivating the team, serving them, coaching them and inspiring others.
       <br>
       <br>
       In relation to methods and resources the team project leader can use these can vary but are mostly technology based and include email , in house databases and some experience of marketing through a previous job.
       <br>
       <br>
       Digital Project Managers use various resources when planning projects the first being content management systems to manage their data and resources for their project , when building a website this is a crucial tool used , it's easy to download and user friendly making it crucial for design.
       <br>
       <br>
       HTML is the next skill that is required as if working in a team and the leader knows this skill it helps less experienced  developers if the project is falling behind especially useful for devoting time to more complex tasks if the team leader focuses on HTML , Social Media is critical for project leaders as knowing when to engage with sites like facebook and  twitter as project ideas can be beneficial to the work.
       <br>
       <br>
       This can lead to advertisements within these popular sites for getting your project known to get people talking about it especially if it is a website for something not currently known about like a video game.

<h3>Unit 1 , Outcome 3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT 
    </h3>
       
<p>

       To Plan and make my website I will use various technology and methods to achieve my goals , firstly to plan my website and know my checklist i use Trello and have a board to plan my goals , such as  creating website , tasks currently being completed and References.
       <br>
       <br>
       I have included a link to my trello board and this is what I am using to plan the website for example logging what I need to do ,  in my website design I will be mainly using Visual Studio Code to design and code the website which i learned in week 1 of Develop Coding at Code Nation i learned the basics of Javascript and will incorporate this into my website design.

<h3> 1.4 ,  Describe the risks that might impact digital projects
   </h3>

<p>

        There are risks that can impact digital projects in serious ways the main one is funding and companies pulling out if they face financial difficulty , executives of companies can also suddenly pull funding if they don't agree with a project that is not going in the right direction.
        <br>
        <br>
       Poor Money management and miscalculation of costs for supplies are another bad example of how projects can go wrong , for example a company may go to a cheaper supplier and the money could be wasted if it isn't suitable for the organisation. 
        <br>
        <br>
       Next risk is Schedules and these are major important because companies have to meet deadlines and schedules can go wrong through mismanaging diary systems or technology , the risk that activities will take longer than expected , Slippages in schedule typically increase costs and delay the receipt of project benefits, with a possible loss of competitive advantage. 
        <br>
        <br>
       Performance Risk is another issue within a company  and this can occur when a specification for a project and a set way of doing it can lead to issues within a group team environment , one person may take over and know more than the others , this can cause someone to dictate the group coursework and make a project fail due to things being completed incorrectly because of one person. 
        <br>
        <br>
       their risks to consider are outside parties or software that you use being updated like IOS for example when you are working on a project using a current operating system , Apple could release a newer software update and this could mean your work because it is on the older operating system fails to load or has bugs. 
        <br>
        <br>
<h3> 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software
    </h3>

<p>
        When selecting IT systems and the right technology and software for my website design I would research  what I have to consider what the benefits and advantages of the software is and more advantageous to my task. For Example if i was working on a website I would research what software such as design and coding I would use for the development. 
        <br>
        <br>
        beginner based tools are more useful for my level of coding , tutorials would benefit me to help make the website efficiently. The next consideration I would consider would be the features included in the tech i use , free features would be more beneficial to a paid account as this allows complete customisation and offers more than having to sign up for a paid account.
        <br>
        <br>
        Virtual Studio Code i have used regularly and it is easily available and has over 100 coding languages such as Javascript , HTML and CSS, this is a good tech to use for beginners and is fast and quick to achieve what I need , whether I am designing what my website looks like or using Javascript to put my text for the website.
        <br>
        <br>
<h3> 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. 
  </h3>

<p>

        Using Trello has helped me because on my trello board I have planned out what i am doing for each task for example i have a board for each task i am working on such as 1.1 and when i have completed this i will tick this as done on my board helping me to track what has been done.
        <br>
        <br>
        Trello is easy to follow and remind me of what i am currently working on , trello also uses the Kanban System which is easy to keep track of during work and allows lists to be created for the benefits of my project.
        <br>
        <br>
        Git  is an Open Source distributed version control system ,  It is mainly used for source code management in software development.  Github is a web based hosting service and helps with code version control on that it is extremely popular with coders and for development purposes it is like social media for experienced developers.
        <br>
        <br>
        using this allows me to upload code and back files up on the system , allowing me to document my work and showcase it. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Since Github is a repository it allows me to track changes in my code across different versions and can integrate with other systems like amazon and google cloud if i were to use these in the future.
        <br>
        <br>

    </a>

<h3> 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects
   </h3>

<p>

         Legal Guidelines that impact digital projects are very numerous the first most important one is you have to disclose the Identity of your business , this includes Company Name so you can be identified , the registered address and the place of registration.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other details needed to be included are the postal address and email address , for people who are not technical and cant access computers the company must include a way to be contacted through non electronic means , so it is key the business has this sorted for digital projects.
        <br>
        <br>
        GDPR regulations are next and majorly affect businesses these came into effect in may 2018 and improves the rights of people who want to access their own data and how it is being processed , it needs to be made clear when signing up to a company through a form or email application.
        <br>
        <br>
        Companies can make the customers opt in so data is only given through consent and can make it easier for customers to opt out , lastly also have a process for data breaches in worst case scenarios.
        <br>
